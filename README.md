# shitpost

# Live on [twitter](http://twitter.com/postingshittily)

## Dependencies:
`tweepy`  
Optional: `netifaces`

## To call upon the bot

By default, there are a few things the bot replies to. This may change instance to instance.

Asking the bot to `gimme a shitpost` or`gimme a public shitpost` will make it reply. As long as the tweet has `public` in it, it will be prefixed with a `.`. If the tweet has `just` and `do it` in it, it will tweet as though it normally tweeted.
